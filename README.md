## Preface

Hi and welcome to my mod! I am [@Daxtor134](https://github.com/Daxtor134). In this Preface I am going to go over what this mod is as well as what it
does.

What is MCBetterBiomes? MCBetterBiomes is a mod to add more biomes, ores, trees, and much more. It also includes a resource pack too. MCBetterBiomes
is made to work alongside other mods and the vanilla game as it is. This mod will be updated throughout its life-time and soon *hopefully* I may update
it to MC-1.19.
